## STORAGE BOXX
Storage Boxx is a simple PHP Inventory Management System. This is not the “super professional crazy bloated with a lot of features” kind of system. But it does cover the basics and has a built-in HTML webcam QR code scanner. This should help the small businesses get started with their inventory stock keeping.
